  _May Contain Lies, by Alex Edmans_ 
  **Basic Summary**- don't trust the numbers; people generally fall back on their biases, and the data supports their thoughts and feelings. He's pretty _snarky_ and pokes holes in many theories of books I've previously **read and enjoyed**. He definitely is not a Malcolm Gladwell, Angela Duckworth, or Amy Cuddy fan. He encourages folks to use _critical thinking_ by asking people to measure what data they is being presented. 
 • A Statement is Not Fact
 • A Fact is Not Data
 • Data is Not Evidence: Data Mining
 • Data is Not Evidence: Causation
 • When Data is Evidence  • Evidence is Not Proof
_Can this statement have another explanation? Can this story be interchangeable?_ 

Was it **worth** the _listen_? He's snarky and condescending, with a lovely English accent. His insight is interesting, but at the end of the day, I may be interested in facts and solid data, but the majority of people are not. I think they'll continue listening and following misinformation and made-up facts.
