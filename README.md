* May Contain Lies, by Alex Edmans* Basic Summary- don't trust the numbers; people generally fall back on their biases and what data supports their thoughts and feelings. He's pretty snarky and pokes holes in many theories of books I've previously read and enjoyed. He definitely is not a Malcolm Gladwell, Angela Duckworth, or Amy Cuddy fan. He encourages folks to use critical thinking by asking people to measure what data they are being presented. 
• A Statement is Not Fact
• A Fact is Not Data
• Data is Not Evidence: Data Mining
• Data is Not Evidence: Causation
• When Data is Evidence
• Evidence is Not Proof
Can this statement have another explanation? Can this story be interchangeable? 

Was it worth the listen? He's snarky and condescending, with a lovely English accent. His insight is interesting, but at the end of the day, I may be interested in facts and solid data, but the majority of people are not. I think they'll continue listening and following misinformation and made-up facts.
